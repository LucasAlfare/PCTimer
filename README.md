# My Puzzle Timer

This is my final repository to hold my final speedcubing timer project. For some years I was practicing programming in
some contexts, and now I decided to use all of those knowledge to build this application.

Doing this I hope mix concepts of the most various programming topics, going from architectures decisions to graphic
rendering or even design stuff and networking.

Also, my aim in creating this is not release something to compete with other applications of this same type, but put my
knowing in check seeing if I can really write the application from the beginning to the end.

# Main application overview

I'm designing this app to work more customizable I can. This means that other users can extend its functions to make it
have any kind of GUI or even different kind of statistics.

Also, after finished, the separated packages will work as libraries, offering all of its functions to be used anywhere.

# Features

I'm working in a timer which offers the main features that I need by myself. However, is known that this can work for
distinct persons once they are very useful by the way. Those features are:

- Timing solutions with a good precision (is the nanosecond precision implementation worth it?);
- Great variety of scrambling tools;
- Good statistics measurement;
- A nice data management included.

There are other features in mind being planed to be implemented after basic application finish, like:

- Specific training tools (blindfolded, speffz helpers, nice sequences keyboard typing helper, and so on);
- Networking: 1 or more cubers will be able to connect themselves in the timer and share those solutions;
- Virtual 3D puzzles to play/time.

All of those features I plan to implement the most possible by myself, using my own knowledge for this. Reinventing the
wheel today is not a good thing to do, but in terms of study is one of the most powerful weapons. :)
